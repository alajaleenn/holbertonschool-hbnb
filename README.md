## Description
HBNB is a project that aims to clone Airbnb.
It focuses on building a complete property rental management system with a scalable architecture, starting from a command-line interface and evolving into a dynamic web application connected to a database.

- Detailed Class Diagram for Business Logic Layer

## UML
Create a high-level package diagram that illustrates the three-layer architecture of the HBnB application and the communication between these layers via the facade pattern. This diagram will provide a conceptual overview of how the different components of the application are organized and how they interact with each other.

## Detailed Class Diagram for Business Logic Layer
Design a detailed class diagram for the Business Logic layer of the HBnB application. This diagram will depict the entities within this layer, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them. The primary goal is to provide a clear and detailed visual representation of the core business logic, focusing on the key entities: User, Place, Review, and Amenity.

## Sequence
Develop sequence diagrams for at least four different API calls to illustrate the interaction between the layers (Presentation, Business Logic, Persistence) and the flow of information within the HBnB application. The sequence diagrams will help visualize how different components of the system interact to fulfill specific use cases, showing the step-by-step process of handling API requests.

## Documentation Compilation
Compile all the diagrams and explanatory notes created in the previous tasks into a comprehensive technical document. This document will serve as a detailed blueprint for the HBnB project, guiding the implementation phases and providing a clear reference for the system’s architecture and design.
